# Beverage Tracker

## JavaScript Weekend Project

### Week 14 at Skill Distillery - December 15, 2019

Built by:

-   [Vinton Lee](http://vintonlee.dev)

This was a weekend project to exceed the minimum viable product for our 3rd Event Tracker assignment.

### Overview:

This program uses an Angular front end and is designed to be a web application that creates, reads, updates and deletes beverage data from a database using the REST API from Part 1.

### How to run:

Access the application at [BeverageTracker](http://3.132.229.160:8080/EventTracker/).

From there, you can get a list of all the beverages, click on one of the beverages in the table for details, update that beverage or delete it. The user can also add beverages, and you can get totals from a day it was input on.

### Technologies used:

-   Front-End: TypeScript, Angular, HTML, CSS, and JSON
-   Back-End: Java, Java Persistence API, Hibernate, REST API, Gradle, and JSON
-   IDE and Tools: Visual Studios Code, Spring Boot, MySQL Workbench, Postman and Atom
-   Deployment: Apache Tomcat and AWS
-   Repository: Git, and GitHub.

### Topics implemented:

-   Build a HTML front end with TypeScript.

-   Send asynchronous requests to Java controllers with HTTP to perform CRUD.

-   Consume and parse JSON responses with Angular.

-   Tomcat 8 on AWS EC2 Instance.

-   Test-Driven Development.

### Lessons learned:

This project helped me better grasp the capabilities of Angular and REST API by allowing me to better learn how to:

-   Adding scripts to a web application
-   Send asynchronous requests to Java controllers with HTTP
-   Send and receive JSON
-   Build HTML with JavaScript
-   Send POST/PUT/DELETE requests
