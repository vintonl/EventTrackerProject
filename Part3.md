## JavaScript Weekend Project

### Week 14 at Skill Distillery - December 15, 2019

Built by:

-   [Vinton Lee](http://vintonlee.dev)

This was a weekend project to exceed the minimum viable product for our 3rd Event Tracker assignment.

### Overview:

This program is designed to be a web application that creates, reads, updates and deletes beverage data from a database. It was built as a HTML front end with JavaScript by adding scripts to index page.

### How to run:

Access the application at [BeverageTracker](http://3.132.229.160:8080/EventTracker/).

From there, you can get a list of all the beverages, click on one of the beverages for details, update that beverage or delete it. The user can also add beverages, and they can get totals from a day they input.

### Technologies used:

Java, JavaScript, Java Persistence API, REST API, Spring Boot, Gradle, MySQL Workbench, Postman, JSON, Apache, Tomcat, AWS, Atom, Git, and GitHub.

### Topics implemented:

-   Build a HTML front end with JavaScript by adding scripts to a web application.

-   Send asynchronous requests to Java controllers with JavaScript's XMLHttpRequest to preform CRUD.

-   Consume and parse JSON responses with JavaScript.

-   Tomcat 8 on AWS EC2 Instance.

-   Test Driven Development.

### Lessons learned:

This project helped me better grasp the capabilities of REST API by allowing me to better learn how to:

-   Adding scripts to a web application
-   Send asynchronous requests to Java controllers with JavaScript's XMLHttpRequest
-   Consume and parse JSON responses with JavaScript
-   Build HTML with JavaScript
-   Send POST/PUT/DELETE requests with XMLHttpRequest

### Stretch Goals Completed:

-   Supplemental table, mappings, and controller routes for nested CRUD.
